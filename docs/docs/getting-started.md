# Getting started

A very small library of styled components for layouting.


### What you'll need
- React

### How to install
```bash
npm install layout-emotions
```

### When to use
This library is specifically targeted to be used for `css in js` requirements.

#### Ideal usage example
- You don't need an entire bootstap css to be loaded only for layouting.
- You don't want your library to be dependent on external css libraries which requires extra configuration for your library to work everytime it is used.
